# Multi-User Admin Dashboard System Guide

## Overview

Your Ride Request App now supports **multiple admin users** working simultaneously with **real-time updates**! Here's everything you need to know.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **User Authentication System**
- ✅ Secure JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt for security
- ✅ Session persistence (stays logged in across browser refreshes)
- ✅ Individual user accounts with unique usernames and passwords

### 2. **User Management**
- ✅ Create new admin users
- ✅ Deactivate/activate users
- ✅ Role-based access (Admin, Super Admin)
- ✅ View all users and their last login times
- ✅ Cannot delete your own account (safety feature)

### 3. **Real-Time Updates**
- ✅ WebSocket-based instant synchronization
- ✅ All admins see changes immediately when any admin updates a ride request
- ✅ Notifications when other admins connect/disconnect
- ✅ Notifications when new ride requests arrive
- ✅ Activity logging to track who made what changes

## 🚀 How It Works

### Real-Time Synchronization

When **Admin 1** updates a ride request status:
1. The change is saved to the database
2. **WebSocket broadcasts** the update to all connected admins
3. **Admin 2, Admin 3, etc.** instantly see the update on their screens
4. They receive a notification: "Admin1 updated a ride request"
5. No manual refresh needed!

### Activity Tracking

Every action is logged with:
- Who performed the action
- What action was taken
- When it happened
- IP address for security

## 🔐 Default Login

**Username:** `admin`  
**Password:** `admin123`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Change the default password after first login!

## 📝 How to Use

### Creating New Admin Users

1. Log in to the admin dashboard
2. Click the **👥 Users icon** in the top right header
3. Click **"+ Add New User"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Username**: Unique username (required)
   - **Full Name**: Display name (required)
   - **Email**: Optional contact email
   - **Password**: Secure password (minimum 6 characters, required)
   - **Role**: Choose Admin or Super Admin
5. Click **"Create User"**
6. The new user can now log in with their credentials!

### Managing Existing Users

In the Users Management modal, you can:
- **View all users** with their:
  - Full name
  - Username
  - Email
  - Role (Admin/Super Admin)
  - Status (Active/Inactive)
  - Last login time
  
- **Deactivate users**: Temporarily disable access
- **Activate users**: Re-enable deactivated accounts

### Multi-User Collaboration

**Scenario**: You and your driver both need access to manage ride requests.

1. **Create Driver Account**
   - Username: `driver`
   - Full Name: Sebastian
   - Role: Admin

2. **Both Log In Simultaneously**
   - You on your computer/phone
   - Driver on their phone

3. **Work Together in Real-Time**
   - When driver accepts a ride → You see it instantly
   - When you send a quote → Driver sees it instantly
   - Connection status shows how many admins are online

## 🔄 Real-Time Update Examples

### Example 1: New Ride Request
```
Customer submits ride request
    ↓
ALL admins hear notification sound
    ↓
ALL admins see: "New ride request received!"
    ↓
Ride request appears in dashboard for everyone
```

### Example 2: Status Update
```
Admin A changes status to "Quoted"
    ↓
WebSocket broadcasts to all admins
    ↓
Admin B sees: "AdminA updated a ride request"
    ↓
Admin B's dashboard refreshes automatically
    ↓
Both see the same updated status
```

### Example 3: Multiple Admins Online
```
Admin 1 logs in
    ↓
Admin 2 logs in → Admin 1 sees: "Admin2 connected (2 online)"
    ↓
Admin 3 logs in → Everyone sees: "Admin3 connected (3 online)"
    ↓
Admin 2 logs out → Others see: "Admin2 disconnected (2 online)"
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (never stored in plain text)
2. **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication tokens with 24-hour expiration
3. **Activity Logging**: Every action is tracked with user ID and IP address
4. **Session Management**: Automatic logout on token expiration
5. **HTTPS Ready**: Works with SSL/TLS for encrypted connections

## 🔧 Technical Details

### WebSocket Connection

- **Protocol**: Socket.IO over WebSocket
- **Fallback**: Long polling if WebSocket unavailable
- **Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- **Authentication**: Token-based WebSocket authentication

### Database Tables

#### `admin_users`
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- username (Unique)
- password_hash (bcrypt)
- full_name
- email
- role (admin, super_admin)
- is_active (1 or 0)
- created_at
- last_login
```

#### `activity_logs`
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key → admin_users)
- username
- action (login, logout, update_ride_status, create_user, etc.)
- target_type (ride_request, admin_user)
- target_id
- details (JSON string with additional info)
- ip_address
- created_at
```

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/admin/login` - User login (returns JWT token)
- `POST /api/admin/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/admin/verify` - Verify token validity

#### User Management
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Deactivate user (soft delete)

#### Ride Requests (Now Protected)
- `PATCH /api/ride-requests/:id/status` - Update status (requires auth token)

### WebSocket Events

#### Client → Server
- `authenticate` - Authenticate WebSocket connection with JWT

#### Server → Client
- `authenticated` - Authentication successful
- `auth_error` - Authentication failed
- `admin_connected` - Another admin connected
- `admin_disconnected` - Another admin disconnected
- `new_ride_request` - New ride request submitted
- `ride_request_updated` - Ride request status changed
- `user_created` - New admin user created
- `user_updated` - Admin user modified
- `user_deleted` - Admin user deactivated

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Business Owner
1. Create separate accounts for each person who needs access
2. Regularly review the user list and deactivate unused accounts
3. Use strong, unique passwords for each account
4. Monitor the activity logs to see who's doing what

### For Multiple Admins
1. **Communicate**: Use the real-time notifications to coordinate
2. **Don't duplicate work**: Check if someone else is already handling a request
3. **Trust the sync**: Changes appear instantly - no need to refresh manually
4. **Stay logged in**: The system maintains your session across page refreshes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Real-time connection lost. Using polling..."
- **Cause**: WebSocket connection failed
- **Fix**: The system automatically falls back to polling every 60 seconds
- **Impact**: Updates are slower (60s delay) but still work

### "Invalid or expired token"
- **Cause**: Your login session expired (24 hours)
- **Fix**: Log out and log in again
- **Impact**: None - just need to re-authenticate

### Updates not showing for other users
- **Check**: Are they both logged in?
- **Check**: Is WebSocket connected? (Check browser console)
- **Fix**: Refresh the page to reconnect WebSocket
- **Fallback**: Polling updates every 60 seconds automatically

### Cannot create new user - "Username already exists"
- **Cause**: Username must be unique
- **Fix**: Choose a different username
- **Tip**: Try adding numbers or using email-style usernames

## 📊 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Family Business
- **You**: Super Admin (manage users + rides)
- **Spouse**: Admin (manage rides)
- **Driver**: Admin (view rides, update status)

### Use Case 2: Small Fleet
- **Dispatcher**: Super Admin (central coordinator)
- **Driver 1**: Admin (their own rides)
- **Driver 2**: Admin (their own rides)

### Use Case 3: 24/7 Operation
- **Day Shift Admin**: Works 8am-8pm
- **Night Shift Admin**: Works 8pm-8am
- **Manager**: Super Admin (monitors all activity)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Ideas for future improvements:
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Per-user ride filtering (each admin sees only their rides)
- [ ] Chat/messaging between admins
- [ ] Push notifications on mobile devices
- [ ] Activity report export (CSV/PDF)
- [ ] Role-based permissions (restrict certain actions)

## 📞 Support

The system is fully functional and ready to use! If you need to modify anything:
1. User passwords are in the database (`ride_requests.db`)
2. JWT secret key is in `server.js` (line 50) - change for production!
3. Activity logs are stored in `activity_logs` table for auditing

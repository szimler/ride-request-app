# üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps Setup - Step by Step

## Why You Need This:
Without Google Maps API, the app can't calculate distances/times automatically.
**Result:** You have to enter prices manually (what's happening now).

## üéØ What Auto-Calculation Does:
1. You click "Send Quote"
2. App sends addresses to Google Maps
3. Google returns: "15.2 miles, 23 minutes"
4. App calculates: "15.2 √ó $1.00 √ó 1.3 = $19.76"
5. Shows you: "Suggested Price: $20.00"
6. You can accept or adjust it

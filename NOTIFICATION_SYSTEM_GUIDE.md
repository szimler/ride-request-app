# 🔔 Enhanced Notification System Guide

- The entire ride card has a **glowing green border**
- You can tell at a glance which rides need attention

### 3. **Multiple Ways to Acknowledge (Stop Notifications)**

- **Click any action button** (Pre-Quote, Send Quote, Not Available, etc.)
- The green border disappears and notifications stop immediately

## 📱 iPhone Considerations

### ⚠️ Important iPhone Limitations

#### 1. **Vibration API**
- **Safari/Chrome on iPhone**: Vibration API is **NOT supported** in regular browser tabs
- **Workaround**: Vibration only works if you "Add to Home Screen" and run as a PWA (Progressive Web App)
- **Alternative**: Rely on sound + visual flash + browser notifications instead

#### 2. **Browser Notifications**
- **Safari on iPhone**: Browser notifications work BUT have strict requirements:
  - User must explicitly grant permission
  - App must be in "Add to Home Screen" mode for best results
  - Notifications may be delayed if Safari is backgrounded for a long time
  
- **Chrome on iPhone**: Similar limitations to Safari

#### 3. **Best Setup for iPhone**

**Option A: Add to Home Screen (Recommended for PWA-like experience)**
1. Open `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/admin` in Safari
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Name it "Rider Admin" and tap **Add**
5. Open from home screen icon
6. Grant notification permissions when prompted

**Option B: Regular Browser (Good enough)**
1. Open admin in Safari or Chrome
2. Keep the browser tab **active** or in foreground
3. Enable notifications in settings
4. Sound + Visual Flash will work perfectly
5. Browser notifications may have delays when backgrounded

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working on iPhone?

**Problem**: No vibration
- **Cause**: Vibration API not supported in browser on iOS
- **Fix**: Add app to Home Screen or rely on sound/visual/browser notifications

**Problem**: No browser notifications when app is minimized
- **Cause**: iOS limits background browser notifications
- **Fix**: 
  - Keep Safari tab active/foreground
  - Or add to Home Screen for better notification support
  - Enable "Allow Notifications" in Safari settings

**Problem**: Sound not playing
- **Cause**: iPhone ringer might be off, or browser permissions not granted
- **Fix**:
  - Check ringer/volume switch on side of phone
  - Ensure Safari has permission to play audio
  - Test sound in settings

**Problem**: No repeating notifications
- **Cause**: May be using old code version
- **Fix**: Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on desktop, clear Safari cache on iPhone)

### Notifications Not Working on Android?

**Problem**: No notifications
- **Cause**: Permissions not granted
- **Fix**: 
  - Go to Chrome settings → Site settings → Notifications
  - Allow notifications for your app URL
  - Reload the page

## 🚀 How It Works (Technical)

### Flow
1. **New Ride Request** arrives via WebSocket
2. System adds ride ID to `unacknowledgedRides` Set
3. **Immediate notification** plays (sound + visual + browser)
4. **Interval starts** - repeats notification every 10 seconds
5. **Admin acknowledges** by clicking card or action button
6. Ride ID removed from `unacknowledgedRides` Set
7. **Interval cleared** - notifications stop
8. Green border and badge removed from UI

### Acknowledgment Triggers
- Clicking anywhere on ride card (excluding buttons/links)
- Clicking "Pre-Quote (Driver)"
- Clicking "Send Quote to Rider"
- Clicking "Not Available (SMS)"
- Clicking "Confirm Booking"
- Any action that engages with the ride

## 📊 Best Practices

### For Maximum Reliability

1. **Grant All Permissions**
   - Notifications
   - Audio playback
   - (Vibration on Android)

2. **Keep Browser Active**
   - On iPhone: Keep Safari in foreground or add to Home Screen
   - On Android: Background notifications work well

3. **Test Your Setup**
   - Use the **Test Notification** and **Test Visual Flash** buttons in settings
   - Ensure you hear/see/feel the alerts

4. **Adjust Patterns**
   - Start with "Urgent" sound and "Red Pulse" visual
   - Adjust based on your environment (quiet office vs noisy street)

5. **Monitor Multiple Devices**
   - Have admin panel open on both desktop and phone
   - Desktop for detailed work, phone for instant alerts

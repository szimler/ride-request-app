## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Detection

The admin dashboard automatically detects the service type:

```javascript
if (request.service_type === 'hourly') {
    // Show hourly-specific information
    // Use hours_needed, estimated_total, notes
    // Display hourly rate calculation
} else {
    // Show standard trip information
    // Use distance_miles, duration_minutes
    // Display mileage-based pricing
}
```

### Default Pricing

**For Hourly Service:**
- If `estimated_total` exists: Use that value
- If not: Calculate as `hours_needed × $45/hour`
- Display both total price AND per-hour rate

**For Standard Trip:**
- Calculate using Google Maps API (distance + time)
- Use tiered pricing structure (short/medium/long trips)
- Display distance in miles, duration in minutes

---

## 📋 What You'll See in Admin Dashboard

### When Hourly Request Arrives:

1. **Request Card** shows:
   - Yellow "HOURLY SERVICE" banner
   - "3 Hours Needed"

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Hourly Service Requests:

1. **Review the hours needed** - Check if customer's request makes sense
2. **Check special notes** - See what they plan to do (shopping, errands, etc.)
3. **Adjust price if needed** - Default is $45/hr, but you can change it
4. **Pre-quote driver first** - Let driver know it's hourly before quoting customer
5. **Send quote** - Use the popup to send formatted quote to rider

### Price Adjustments:

**Default Rate:** $45/hour

**You can adjust for:**
- Long duration (e.g., $40/hr for 5+ hours)
- Premium time (e.g., $50/hr for late night)
- Special requests (e.g., $55/hr if includes waiting)

Just edit the price in the quote popup before sending!

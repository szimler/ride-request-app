CONVERSATION EVIDENCE:
================================================================================

User Question Today: "did we talk about the prices for quoting rides in this chat?"
My Response: "No, we did not discuss pricing formulas..."

User Question Today: "we used to have that in the admin app. It was working. 
                      There are no back ups?"

in this chat. It's been working the whole time!

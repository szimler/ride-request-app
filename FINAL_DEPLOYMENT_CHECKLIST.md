- Upload 6 files: ~15-20 minutes (3 min per file)
- Render deployment: ~2-3 minutes per commit
- Testing: ~5-10 minutes

**Render Auto-Deploys After Each Commit:**

## 🆘 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK:

### **Google Maps Not Calculating:**
- Check if API key is set in Render environment variables
- Ensure Distance Matrix API is enabled
- Billing must be set up (free tier available)

### **Audio Not Playing:**
- Check browser permissions (may need to interact with page first)
- Check settings modal - ensure audio is enabled
- Try test sound button

### **SMS Links Not Opening:**
- Some browsers block sms: links
- Try different browser (Chrome, Safari usually work)
- On mobile, should work perfectly

### **Status Not Updating:**

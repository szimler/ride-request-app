# Quick Multi-User Reference Card

## 🎯 What's New?

Your admin dashboard now supports **multiple users working simultaneously with real-time updates**!

## 🔑 Quick Start

### Default Login
```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

### Create New User
1. Login → Click 👥 Users icon (top right)
2. Click "+ Add New User"
3. Fill form → Create User
4. Share credentials with new user

## ⚡ How Real-Time Works

### Scenario: Two Admins Working Together

**Admin 1** (You):
- Updates ride status to "Quoted"
- Sends $45 quote

**Admin 2** (Driver):
- **Instantly sees** the update
- Gets notification: "Admin1 updated a ride request"
- Dashboard automatically refreshes
- No manual refresh needed!

### What Syncs in Real-Time?
✅ New ride requests (all admins hear notification)  
✅ Status updates (pending → quoted → confirmed)  
✅ Quote prices and details  
✅ Admin connections/disconnections  
✅ User management changes  

## 🔄 Connection Status

When users connect/disconnect, everyone sees:
```
"Admin2 connected (3 online)" 
"Admin2 disconnected (2 online)"
```

This tells you exactly who else is working right now!

- **You**: Manage quotes and customer communication
- **Driver**: Update ride status (confirmed, completed)
- **Benefit**: Both see changes instantly, no confusion

### Use Case 2: Day/Night Shifts
- **Day Admin**: Works 8am-8pm
- **Night Admin**: Works 8pm-8am

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Each admin gets their own login** - Don't share passwords
2. **Changes are instant** - No need to refresh manually
3. **Can't delete yourself** - Prevents accidental lockout
4. **24-hour sessions** - Auto-logout after 24h for security
5. **All actions are logged** - Activity tracking for accountability

## 🔍 Testing It Yourself

Want to see it in action?

1. **Open two browser windows** (or use private/incognito for 2nd)

3. **Make a change** in Window 1 (update a ride status)
